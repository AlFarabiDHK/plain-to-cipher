# Welcome to the Jumble
 
This project uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript to convert plain text to cipher
text instantaneously. It uses Caesar cipher and a simplfied version of two square cipher to encrypt the text.


## How to run
----------------------------------------------------------------
Clone the repo using: `https://github.com/AlFarabiDHK/plain-to-cipher.git`

Then open up the `index.html` to use it!


## Future Improvements
---------------
I have plans on changing the simplified two square version to the actual version. Read more here: [`Two-square cipher`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-square_cipher)
